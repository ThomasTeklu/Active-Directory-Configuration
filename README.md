<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

# DC and Client Setup

To set up this Active Directory Environment, we'll need to create two virtual machines: one serving as a domain controller (DC), and one as a client. Open up Azure and create a resource group. Within the resource group, create a virtual netowrk and a subnet. 

After that, again within that same resource group, create the virtual machine that will serve as the DC. Remember that in order for it to function as DC, the "image" needs to be specifically Micorsoft Server OS. Either one of the two in the image below will work.

As a side note, as much as you can, try to deploy all of these resources to the same regional area.

After taking note of your DC credentials, you need to set the DC's NIC private IP address to be static. To do this we'll need to open the VM within Azure then go to its Network settings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e6f9a4-ec14-402f-81a3-6b6c5c13debc)

Then you need to click on your network interface settings.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5305161-8250-43c1-bca4-b29a4a8f27d7)

After that within the "IP Configurations" pane, you should see an IP address named "ipconfig1". Click on it to manage its settings. Now you should see the option to change the private address from dynamic to static. Go ahead and do such now then hit "Save" at the bottom to finish up.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/204ffdf6-489f-471c-991d-f4ce02ce6ed1)


Now that we've established the DC's private IP address as static, we're going to modify a certain setting that will allow us to test for connectivity in a little bit. Let's remote into the DC itself and open up the Control Panel. 

Another side note: open openning/connecting a virtual machine for the first time, one of the initial configuration questions that will be asked is whether or not you want to "allow you PC to be discoverable by other PCs and devices on this network". Select "Yes" for this. Resuming:

After that, click on "System and Security" -> "Windows Defender Firewall" -> "Advanced Settings". From within here, there should be a link titled "Windows Defender Firewall Properties". 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b30beff-928a-4806-8d30-f0e2d8d6b36c)

Click on it and a small window should pop it containing settings of the Windows firewall. In order to allow for connectivity testing, we're going to disable the firewall. This is rarely something that you would do, but for certain scenarios like ours, it'll be acceptable. 

In order to disable the firewall, go through each of the tabs within the window that contain a "Firewall state" section (Domain Profile, Private Profile, and Public Profile), and turn the state off for each of them. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/111227f5-8f02-44b9-b8c5-30367a53378c)

Click "Apply" then "OK" to confirm these edits. You should then see your Windows Defender Firewall window looking like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865814c3-c0c9-4ad0-b7ac-71dad6fbf3ef)

You can now close out of that window. We'll move on to setting up our client machine now.

Back in Azure, create another virtual machine, this time with a Windows 10 Pro "image"/OS. Also, make sure to configure it to be in the same geographical location as well as the same virtual network as the DC.

The next step will be to configure the client's DNS settings to the DC's private IP address. Of course for this you will need to locate the private IP address of the DC. Go again to the networks settings within the DC virtual machine settings. Again click on the network interface settings. This time however, we'll click on "DNS Servers": 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e152613-6887-4f72-8112-b04b6cbacd62)

Change the setting from "Inherit from virtual network" to "Custom" then enter in the private IP address of your DC:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5067db87-8b02-4271-a8d5-8a45190cb6fa)

Don't forget to hit "Save" at the top when you're finished with that. Now we're ready to move to the last part of the Setup Section. From the Azure Portol, restart your client machine. Then remote log in to it. Using the command prompt, ping your DC's private IP address and ensure that it succeeded: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/528d556c-1351-446e-8340-ae3e35dfea70)

Finally, open PowerShell and run **ipconfig /all**. The output for the DNS settings should have your DC's private IP address:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a64c0075-e20f-48a7-b02e-ca61d7f7f08b)

And with that, you have successfully completed your domain controller and client setup. In the next section below, you will be guiding through installation of Active Directory itself.




# Installation of Active Directory

Remote into your DC. Since the domain controller is running on Windows Server OS, the initial view will be different from other OS's. You should immediately see the Server Manager open upon login:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32481eb9-60da-4a4d-b76e-39b1dae3d715)

Next, to turn this "blank" (so to speak) server into an Active Directory server, first click on "Add roles and features". For the "Before You Begin", "Installation Type", and "Server Selection" pages, select "Next". Then when you arrive at the "Server Roles" page, you will see a long list of potential services that you could configure to run on your server. We are concerned with Active Directory Domain Services, so that is what we'll select from the list:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09da0585-46b7-4246-8eb5-9505ab770b1e)

Upon selecting its check mark to enable the features, a pop-up window will appear asking to add additional features that are needed for Active Directory. Click "Add Features" then "Next" back in the original window. For "Features" and "AD DS" select "Next" and then within the Confirmation section, check the option for automatic restart:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d836a7dd-086b-4fa9-a6f4-fbcd15709722)

Now hit "Install" and wait for it to complete. Upon completion, you should see the flag icon at the top right has a hazard sign next to it:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1229a7df-4375-4dc4-85fa-0f806d2d2180)

Click on it and then on the "Promote this server to a domain controller" prmopt. From there, select the "Add a new forest" option and specify your desired domain name (i.e. {yourdomainname}.com):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbdc21a2-56e7-4f8a-9159-f5c4c3f0f51a)

Hit "Next" to move on to "Domain Controller Options", then set your Directory Services Restore Mode password. Then keep clicking "Next" until you arrive at the "Prerequisites Check" page. If all checks out, you should see a small banner at the top of the window saying as much:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa743ff-76c2-45c4-ab19-4e6c915d028e)

That's your green light to go ahead and hit "Install" and wait for that to come to a close. You will be logged out since the device has to restart. Upon logging back in, since your virtual machine is now properly a domain controller, your initial credentials won't work. You'll have to add your domain name and a backslash to the front of your username (mydomain.com\example). Your password will still remain as it was. Log in as described above, and then we'll move on to Internal Configuration.



# Internal Configuration

Our first step in this section will be to create a Domain Admin user within the domain


Open up Active Directory Users and Computers either by searching it in the Windows search bar, or by click the start menu then locating to Windows Administrative Tools:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4026b7fe-b68f-491b-99e9-8ee0aa5b9512)

Right click **on** your domain name itself then select "New" and "Organizational Unit". Name it "_EMPLOYEES" (include the underscore in the front). Using the same technique, create another OU named "_ADMINS". 

Within the Employees folder (remember, right clicking on it) create a "user". We'll name them "Jane Doe" with a username of "jane_admin". The password is up to you, just remember to keep track of it of course:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb62fd21-c3aa-45ec-a55b-e2df1c423a0c)

When moving on from username to password creation, deselect the check mark next to "User must change password at next login"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c26c3d0-d045-4feb-b973-55c32b043ae3)

You should now have a new user named "Jane Doe" within your employees group. Now to actually give this account admin privileges, we need to add it to the "Domain Admins" Security Group. Right click on the account and hit "Properties". Within the Properties window, go to the "Member Of" tab and select "Add":

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3e340e7-9cec-4edc-8cd3-135aee637cfb)

You'll be taken to another window to select which groups you want to add this account to. In the field enter "Domain Admins" and hit enter. Automatically you'll be taken back to the "Members Of" tab and you should see "Domain Admins" within the panel now: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48a8089b-cbe4-4c8f-afc0-affaf05adb7c)

To wrap this step up, click "Apply" and "OK" at the bottom of the window.

For organizational measures, right click on Jane Doe and select the "move" option. Move her to the newly-created Admin Security Group. Open the Admins folder to confirm the move was succesful. 

Log out and log back in as "mydomain.com\jane_admin" and use jane_admin as your admin account from here on out.


So now we have established Active Directory services on our server, created our domain, and have designated a particular account as our admin account for the DC. Having focused on our server-side configuration so much, let's go on and move towards setting up our client-side as well.

# Joining Client to Domain

Log in to the client machine as the original local admin. Then, right click on the start icon in the bottom left corner. From there, click "System" and within the window that pops up, select "System Protection". Switch to the "Computer Name" tab and that's where you will see the option to "rename this computer or change its domain or workgroup":

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7adc325b-b972-4ba0-91e6-09e8dee166a8)

From there, select the "Domain" option under "Member of" and enter in your domain name in the field. When you click "OK", a Windows Security panel will show, asking you to use an account with permission to join the domain. This is where your DC admin account will come in handy. Use your credentials (with the domain specification at the beginning) to authorize this domain joining. When that's done, you'll get a "Welcome to the domain" message. Close that and your device will automatically restart to enforce the changes just made.

Verify that your client device shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) by logging back into your DC. Create a new OU named "_CLIENTS" and put your client device in there.

With that, you have successfully joined your client machine to your domain.



# Setup Remote Desktop

Now you will enable Remote Desktop for non-administrative users on the client device. Log into the client device, this time as your domain admin account. Right click on the start icon then select "System". Inside of that select "Remote Desktop" and within the "Remote Desktop Users" window that pops up select "Add". 

You will then enter "Domain Users" in the object names field and hit enter. Select "Ok" after that and you've now enabled any domain user (even non-administrative ones) to log into the client device.


# Creating Users

Log in to your DC as jane_admin. Open PowerShell_ise **as an administrator** and within the new file, paste the contents of [this script](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1). Run the script and observe the accounts being created, the process of which can be seen by clicking on the image below:

[![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/MCj3oVf.png)](https://imgur.com/2NlibYS)


When finished, open up ADUC and observe the accounts in the appropriate OU (_EMPLOYEES).

As a final test, attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the accounts (remember to take note of the password from within the script).


### Account Management

We'll wrap up our Active Directory activities by experimenting with enabling and unlocking accounts, as well as reseting passwords. First things first, get logged in to your DC if you're not already. Locate to the employees OU from within ADUC and select a random user. Take note of its credentials and then attempt to log into the client device with a bad password 10 times. 

Notice that nothing is happening. You're simply not able to log in and offered another chance to try. Typically you would want some type of prevention against this to ensure that brute force attacks or something of the sort are unsuccessful. That's what we'll move on to setting up right now. 

# Configuring Account Lockout Group Policy

Log into the DC. Click the seach bar and type gpmc.msc, then press Enter. This is the Group Policy Management Console from which we will configure the account policy:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7e9824c-c574-434d-b3b0-61b463cc93c4)

Navigate to the Group Policy Objects, then select "New" to make a new Group Policy Object (GPO):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b8a6173-d041-40ba-aabc-f16e2c7cf705)

Give the new GPO the name "Account Lockout Policy". Now, right click that newly created GPO and select "Edit" to open the Group Policy Management Editor. Expand the following: Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy.

There are three main settings that you'll configure here: 
1. Account Lockout Duration
2. Account Lockout Threshold
3. Resent Account Lockout Counter After

To edit any of them, double click on them. Start with Account Lockout Duration (time that an account remains locked before it's automatically unlocked again). Select "Define this policy setting" and set it to 30 minutes. Hit "Apply" then "OK".

Note that upon changing this setting, you'll automatically be offered other suggested value changes for the two categories:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8093460-018b-4c83-900f-132510d5c42d)

Hit "OK" to move on and you'll change them right after. For Account Lockout Threshold (amount of failed login attempts that trigger a lockout), define 3 invalid login attempts, and for Reset Account Lockout Counter After (time after which failed login attempts counter is reset) define 15 minutes.

After setting those values, you'll need to link the GPO to an Organizational Unit (OU) or domain wherein you want the policy to apply. Go back to the Group Policy Manager Window and right-click on your domain, then select "Link an Existing GPO". Within that window, select the one you just created: Account Lockout Policy.

We'll now force a Group Policy update by opening Command Prompt and typing in "gpupdate /force", then hitting enter. To verify the policy, you can use the rsop.msc tool on a client machine to see the applied settings.
